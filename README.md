# SPLIT.IT

### Group Project

This app was designed and built by Erica Kantor, Gray Reinhard, Aaron Gregory, Ariel Olin, and Evan Berg.  The purpose of this app is to provide a seamless experience in splitting up the costs of an event, be it a vacation, a convert, or a bachelorette party.  

### How To Use This App

Sign up, create your profile, and create an event!  Once the event is created you can invite friends, add expenses and decide how they are to be broken up amongst your crew.  The app will take in all expenses, people attending, how long they are attending, length of the event, and breakdown all costs according to how you want.
